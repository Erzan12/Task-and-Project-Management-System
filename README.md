2. User Roles:
  Admin: Manages all projects, tasks, and user roles.
  Project Manager: Creates and manages assigned projects,           assigns tasks to team members.
  Team Member: Views and updates tasks assigned to them.
3. Project Management: Create, edit, and track multiple          projects, set deadlines, and assign team members.
4. Task Management: Break projects into tasks, set priority,     assign to users, and track status (e.g., To Do, In           Progress, Completed).
5. Dashboard and Notifications: Overview of tasks and           projects, alerts for upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks.
6. Reports: Generate summaries of task completion, project      status, and team member performance.
